My name is Josi and I am a PhD candidate in statistical genetics and education at the [department of Biological Psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-behavioural-and-movement-sciences/departments/biological-psychology). Under the supervision of dr. Elsje van Bergen and prof. dr. Conor Dolan, I work on modeling gene-environment interplay in the context of childhood educational development. I apply structural equation models to twin data to gain a better understanding of genetical and environmental influences on educational outcomes.\
\
I hold a [Research Master's degree from the University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/research-masters/psychology-research/psychology-research-msc.html), where I majored in Psychological Methods. My time at the UvA has fueled my passion for coding in R and Python to answer questions about human behaviour. In the past, I have worked as a student intern at [BrainsFirst](https://www.brainsfirst.com/nl/home-nl), where I applied machine learning models to occupational data to provide career advice.\
\
My main interests are statistics, twin modeling, childhood development, and causality. I recognize the inherent need for interdisciplinary research in my field, and am curious how genetic findings can be translated into accessible narratives for the general public. I welcome connections with fellow researchers and am open to collaborations!
